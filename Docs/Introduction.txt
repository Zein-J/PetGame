Overview

Virtual pets are digital companions that simulate the experience of caring for a real pet,
providing players with a range of responsibilities like feeding, grooming, and interacting with
their pet. These simulations, popularized by games like Tamagotchi, Neopets, Nintendogs, and
Bitzee, give players a low-stakes environment to manage daily tasks and routines associated with pet care. The success of these virtual pet games lies in their ability to engage users through
simple, repetitive tasks that grow more rewarding over time as the pet’s well-being reflects the
player’s efforts.
For this project, our group will design and implement a virtual pet application using Java. The game will involve managing a digital pet’s needs, such as hunger,
happiness, and health, while encouraging users to maintain regular interaction. Although the
primary aim is to create an engaging and interactive game, there is an educational element that
teaches players simple life skills like responsibility and routine management.

Objectives

Applying the principles of software engineering towards a real-world problem.
Working with, interpreting, and following a detailed specification provided to you.
Creating models of requirements and design from such a specification.
Implementing your design in Java and having to deal with decisions made earlier in the design process.
Creating graphical, user-facing content and applications.
Writing robust and efficient code.
Write good, clean, well-documented Java code that adheres to best practices.
Reflecting on good/bad design decisions made over the course of the project.
